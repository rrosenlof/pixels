# Pixelate
Using Python's pillow library, Pixelate is a tool for creating pixelated versions of images programmatically. I made it for a class project at BYU. You can see some of the images the program creates [here](http://pixel-gallery.surge.sh).

To run the program yourself, clone the project, then run `python3 main.py` from the command line in the root directory. You'll need to edit the parameters of the function call at the end of main.py. Also add a directory with your starting images and another directory where the final images will be saved. 

I'll edit this program at a later date to improve the process of creating/saving the images...
